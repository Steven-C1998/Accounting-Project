# Accounting-Project
This is a persoanl project that I am working on to put into practice what I have learned so far.
It is going to be a work in progress for the forseeable future.
This is not a complete program but it will run. 
Please refer to my Accounting Project page for my progress. 

Version .1
It is currently a very primitive version of an accounting software and incomplete.
Uses .txt files as a database
The data base needs .txt files named "Master.txt" and "FileRecords.txt"

Master.txt Style
Customer number	   Customer name	     Customer balance
I.E.
0000 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX	0.00
Each value is seperate by a space and the name cannot include spaces. Do not include the column headers, only values.

FileRecords.txt Style
O for orders, P for payments
O	Customer number	Transaction number	Item Ordered	Quantity	Cost
I.E.
O 0000 0000 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 0000 0.00
P	0000	0000	Payment amount		
I.E.
P 0000 0000 0.00
